Virtual Game Shelf - Progress Report - March 14, 2017

Progress was unfortunately slow this week for Virtual Game Shelf. As the v0.1
deadline passed by yesterday, it became clear we underestimated the amount of
backend work required for a functional prototype. Our group is currently discussing
whether or not we will still be able to meet our final project deadline.

## Updates

* Progress reports are now stored in the repository as .txt files in \doc
  * The GitHub wiki didn't easily lend itself to weekly articles.
* BlueJ support has been dropped in favor of Eclipse
* #51 TabSepatedFileReader created to parse saved information from .txt files
* #50 MainMenuBar separated into its own file
  * Separate files help keep the code organized as the project grows
* #47 Add "About Game Shelf" screen
* #45 Prototype classes for saving Game and GameList objects

## Obstacles

* GUI work on viewing games is stalled until saving and loading from
  a file is complete
* A large amount of the backend work required for a v0.1 functional prototype
  release has yet to be completed, meaning the deadline will need to delayed.
  This includes features originally intended for v0.0.1.
  * Missing features
    * Ability to save game list to a file (v0.0.1) [backend]
    * Basic Steam API integration (v0.0.1) [backend]
	* Decide whether Backloggery importing is possible (v0.0.1) [backend]
	* Basic Steam library importing (v0.1) [backend]
	* Prototype for viewing games in your library (v0.1) [GUI]
  * Goals without a deadline
    * Loading gameList from a file [GUI/backend]
* Our backend programmer's laptop started having issues which prevent
  him from programming while on campus
  * While Eclipse is installed on some of the University computers, it fails to
    run or is completely missing from many of the student loaner laptops
  * Currently, he is only able to program from his off-campus desktop
