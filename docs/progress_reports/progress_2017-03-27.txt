Virtual Game Shelf - Progress Report - March 27, 2017

Over the past 3 weeks, work has been done to try and keep our project
on schedule for the end of the semester. Unfortunately, due to various
circumstances, our backend programmer has not been able to meet
project deadlines. I may be able to handle some of the backend work myself
if necessary. However, I can't work on code I haven't seen or that hasn't
been uploaded.

The lack of backend code has been a major roadblock for our group.
Groundwork features originally planned for Februaryâ€™s v0.0.1 release
such as basic Steam integration and Backloggery research are still
not complete. The deadline for our functional v0.1 prototype is
now 3 weeks past its original date, and none of the backend milestones
have been met.
