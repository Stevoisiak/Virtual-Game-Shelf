# Virtual Game Shelf - A Game Collection Organizer
Virtual Game Shelf is a desktop Java application to organize your game library
in a single convenient location. It strives to implement the best features
from services like [Backloggery](http://www.backloggery.com/), without
the need for an internet connection.

## Building Virtual Game Shelf

Virtual Game Shelf was compiled using [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) with
the [e(fx)clipse](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html) addon to allow the use
of the JavaFX library.
