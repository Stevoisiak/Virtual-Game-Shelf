# Virtual Game Shelf - A Game Collection Organizer  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Stevoisiak/Virtual-Game-Shelf.svg?token=gNkwZVuxytsxPM98V5kb&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Stevoisiak/Virtual-Game-Shelf)

Virtual Game Shelf is a desktop Java application to organize your
game library in a single convenient location. It strives to implement
the best features from services like [Backloggery](http://www.backloggery.com/),
[VGCollect](https://vgcollect.com), and [My Game Collection](http://my-game-collection.tuyware.com/)
without the need for an internet connection or Android device.

Code contributions should loosely follow [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Compiling with Eclipse

Before trying to compile, make sure [Eclipse Neon](https://www.eclipse.org/),
[e(fx)clipse](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html), and
[EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) are installed.

Select `File -> Import` from the menu, then select `Git -> Projects from Git`
to open the project import wizard. If you haven't already cloned
the project in a separate Git client, select `Clone URI` and
[fill in the necessary information](http://i.imgur.com/pcPI0Wh.png).
Otherwise, use `Existing local repository` and select the project
folder on your computer. Either way, be sure to import the project
as an existing Eclipse project when asked.

You should now be able to compile and run Video Game Shelf in Eclipse.

## Automatic testing with Travis CI

All pull requests are [automatically test compiled](https://travis-ci.com/Stevoisiak/Virtual-Game-Shelf/)
in Travis CI using an Ant `build.xml` file generated by Eclipse.

Travis CI specific settings are defined in `.travis.yml`.
