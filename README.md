# Virtual Game Shelf - A Game Collection Organizer  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Stevoisiak/Virtual-Game-Shelf.svg?token=gNkwZVuxytsxPM98V5kb&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Stevoisiak/Virtual-Game-Shelf)

Virtual Game Shelf is a desktop Java application to organize your
game library in a single convenient location. It strives to implement
the best features from services like [Backloggery](http://www.backloggery.com/),
[VGCollect](https://vgcollect.com), and [My Game Collection]
(http://my-game-collection.tuyware.com/) without the need for an
internet connection or Android device.

Code contributions should loosely follow [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Compiling with BlueJ

In BlueJ, select `Project -> Open Non BlueJ...`. Navigate to the
project directory, select the `src` folder, and click `Open in BlueJ`.
Selecting any other folder may result in a Package Line Mismatch warning.

You should now be able to open and compile the project in BlueJ.

## Compiling with Eclipse

Before trying to compile, make sure [Eclipse Neon](https://www.eclipse.org/) and the
[e(fx)clipse](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html) addon are installed.

On Eclipse's welcome screen, select `Checkout projects from Git` to
open the project import wizard. (You can also use `File -> Import`,
`Git -> Projects from Git`.) If you have already opened the project
with Git, use `Existing local repository` and select the project
folder on your computer. Otherwise, select `Clone URI` and
[fill in the necesary information](http://i.imgur.com/pcPI0Wh.png).
Make sure to import the project as an existing Eclipse project.

You should now be able to compile and run Video Game Shelf in Eclipse.

## Automatic testing with Travis CI

All pull requests are [automatically test compiled](https://travis-ci.com/Stevoisiak/Virtual-Game-Shelf/)
in Travis CI using an Ant `build.xml` file generated by Eclipse.

Travis CI specific settings are defined in `.travis.yml`.
