# Virtual Game Shelf - A Game Collection Organizer
Virtual Game Shelf is a desktop Java application to organize your 
game library in a single convenient location. It strives to implement 
the best features from services like [Backloggery](http://www.backloggery.com/) 
and [My Game Collection](http://my-game-collection.tuyware.com/) without 
the need for an internet connection or Android device.

Code contributions should loosly follow [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Compiling with BlueJ

In BlueJ, Select **`Project -> Open Non BlueJ...`**. Select the project 
folder in the newly opened window and click **`Open in BlueJ`**. 
(By default, the folder should be named **Virtual-Game-Shelf**.) 
You should now be able to open and compile the project in BlueJ.

Note: A Package Line Mismatch warning may appear if project 
files have been recently moved or renamed. If this happens, 
click "continue" to have BlueJ automatically correct the issue.
